# UDPSCAN
A Python based UDP port scanner developed for use with iSH Shell. This was taken from the [FLOOD](https://github.com/cons0le7/FLOOD) tool and modified to include command line parsed arguements for better flexibility and use with automation. It was isolated as a standalone tool due to being unable to use TCP raw sockets on iOS devices. 

## Installation 
```
apk add git
apk add python3
git clone https://github.com/cons0le7/UDPSCAN
cd UDPSCAN
python3 UDPSCAN.py 
```
